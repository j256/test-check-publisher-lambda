Test Check Publisher Lambda
===========================

This is the server side code that takes the results from the
[Test Check Publisher Maven Plugin](https://github.com/j256/test-check-publisher-maven-plugin) and posts them to Github
to annotate a particular commit with check information.

For the full instructions about how to get this working, see the
[Test Check Publisher Github application](https://github.com/apps/test-check-publisher).
